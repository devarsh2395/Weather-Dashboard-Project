# Weather Dashboard Project


## Description

The project is created by using the openweather API. Planning ahead is easier with the 5-day forecast which gives you an insight into the weather for the next five days. Get the information including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the current conditions. And with the search history feature, you can quickly access past searches and view the current and future weather conditions for those cities.
